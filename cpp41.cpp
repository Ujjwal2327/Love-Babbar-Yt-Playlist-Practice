/*
    time complexity- time needed as a function of input given
    TC of reccursion can be found out by recurrence function or by reccursion tree
    space complexity- maximum space needed at any instant of time
    TC of reccursion can be found out by making functioncall stack or by reccursion depth in reccursion tree
